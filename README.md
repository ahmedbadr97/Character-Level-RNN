# Character-Level-RNN
- project for learning purpose only to create sequence data loaders and train LSTM model
## project goal
- construct a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network will train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character.
- training data is 2mb  [text book](dataset/anna.txt)
